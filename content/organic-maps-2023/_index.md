goals: "The overall purpose of the evaluation is to find existing usability issues on the Organic Maps mobile apps so that the project can attract more supporters and contributors."
findings: "An overwhelming amount of negative findings were found. The overall realisation was that the tool requires substantial corrections and modifications to increase its effectiveness and credibility."
closing: "Our closing thoughts about the state of Organic Maps is that overall it is a quite user-friendly mobile mapping application that is perhaps the most user-friendly offering which is FOSS. It is a few small degrees less intuitive or frictionless compared to popular proprietary apps."
