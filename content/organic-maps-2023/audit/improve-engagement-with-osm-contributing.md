@biodranik I am forking this from #5746 due to your response. You communicated to me on our call last week, as well as your first email to me:

> The #1 UX issue we would love to solve is how to educate users about OpenStreetMap.org 

If this is a *real goal*, then having OSM hidden away in Settings and only after adding a Place, I'm afraid you will not change the status quo of users engagement with contributing to OSM.

**Observations**

The current `OpenStreetMap Login` is this:

- One small paragraph of text is not very exciting or engaging for users
- View crams too much into one screen (information, login, and signup)
